# General derivative service for IiifPrint, which is meant to wrap
#   and replace the stock Hyrax::FileSetDerivativeService with a proxy
#   that runs one or more derivative service "plugin" components.
#
#   Note: Hyrax::DerivativeService consumes this, instead of (directly)
#   consuming Hyrax::FileSetDerivativeService.
#
#   Unlike the "run the first valid plugin" arrangement that the
#   Hyrax::DerivativeService uses to run an actual derivative creation
#   service component, this component is:
#
#   (a) Consumed by Hyrax::DerivativeService as that first valid plugin;
#
#   (b) Wraps and runs 0..* plugins, not just the first.
#
# This should be registered to take precedence over default by:
#   Hyrax::DerivativeService.services.unshift(
#     IiifPrint::PluggableDerivativeService
#   )
#
#   Modify IiifPrint::PluggableDerivativeService.plugins
#   to add, remove, or reorder plugin (derivative service) classes.
#
